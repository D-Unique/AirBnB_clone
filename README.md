A Simple Command Line Interpreter

This project is a basic command line interpreter (CLI) that allows you to execute simple commands.

Getting Started
Prerequisites:

A computer with a terminal or command prompt.
Running the Interpreter:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Locate the main interpreter script (e.g., interpreter.py, main.cpp).
4. Execute the script using the appropriate command for your
programming language (e.g., python interpreter.py, ./main).
Example:

$ cd path/to/project/directory
$ python interpreter.py

This will launch the command interpreter. You should see a prompt like >>> or $ indicating it's ready for your commands.

Using the Interpreter
The interpreter allows you to execute built-in commands and potentially your own custom commands (depending on the implementation). Here are some common examples of built-in functionalities:

1. Echo:

>>> echo hello world
hello world
This command simply prints the arguments back to the console.

2.  Basic Arithmetic:

>>> add 5 3
8

>>> multiply 4 2
8
These commands perform basic arithmetic operations on the provided numbers.

3. Exit:

>>> exit
This command exits the interpreter and returns you to the terminal.

Note: The specific set of built-in commands and their syntax may vary depending on the implementation of this project.
